# Crop Management System ðŸŒµ

## Overview
The Crop Management System is a web application designed to help users manage crops, fields, and related resources efficiently. It consists of a **frontend** built with React, Redux, Redux Thunk, and JWT authentication, and a **backend** powered by Express, Prisma, and MySQL.

## Features
### Frontend
- Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern UI.
- **Redux** for state management.
- **Redux Thunk** for handling asynchronous API calls.
- **JWT Authentication** for user login and authorization.
- Dynamic forms for adding, updating, and deleting crops, fields, and related data.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.

### Backend
- **Express.js** for building RESTful APIs.
- **Prisma ORM** for database management with MySQL.
- **JWT Authentication** for secure user sessions.
- CRUD operations for managing crops, fields, and related entities.
- API endpoints for handling user authentication and data management.
